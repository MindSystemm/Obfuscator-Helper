# Obfuscator-Helper
This tool will help obfuscator makers to check their obfuscator's performance

# Description

One of the main goal of obfuscator's makers is not to break performance of original exe.
This tool will calculate some values to print ratio before/after obfuscation

Please keep in mind that you may have to check performance with different exe (small, medium or big)
It's not because your exe work on a simple crackme that it'll work on a big real exe

Enjoy :tada: :lock:
